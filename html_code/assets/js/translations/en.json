  "Vacuum-Desc1": "The YEETBA V1 is a simple vacuum robot made to work efficiently along a user-specified area that can be defined inside the app itself.",
  "Vacuum-Desc2": "At first, we had multiple ideas for the bot, such as making it as a military defense bot, a vacuum robot (our current idea), and also a cooking bot.",
  "Vacuum-Desc3": "Below, you will find images of our code and the robot itself.",
